# Cartpole Balancing with DQN and LQR
This repository contains Python implementations of two different algorithms, Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), used to balance a cartpole system. These implementations were developed as part of a Reinforcement Learning class CS4789

The cartpole balancing problem involves balancing a pole on a cart that can move along a frictionless track. The goal is to apply appropriate control inputs to the cart such that the pole remains upright. In this repository, we implement two different approaches to solve this problem:

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: A reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to balance the cartpole by approximating the optimal action-value function.
- **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**: A classical control method that computes optimal control inputs based on a linearized dynamics model of the cartpole system.
